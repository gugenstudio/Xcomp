**xComp** is an image viewer capable of building composites of a stack of images with transparent regions.

This tool was built to visualize region updates of a render on top of previous renders, in real-time. Images found in a chosen folder to scan for, are quickly composited with alpha blending in a stack. OpenColorIO transformations are optionally added to the composite image, which can be saved out as a PNG.
